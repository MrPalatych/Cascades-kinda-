# NT Style for Windows
![NT Style banner](/misc/banner.png)

## What is NT Style?
NT Style makes your computer look like it's straight out of 1993! Using the same method that Stardock's Windowblinds and  Microsoft's UxTheme employ, every control and titlebar is turned into something straight from vintage Windows.

## What does it run on?
Support and compatibility is provided for all versions of Windows NT with kernel version 5.2 and newer. There is currently only support for IA-32 and AMD64 releases.

## Where do I get it?
The [releases page](https://github.com/freedom7341/NTStyle/releases/latest) has the latest stable release of NT Style. Builds for every commit can be found in the artifacts of the GitHub actions run of said commit.

## How can I help?
Submitting [issues](/issues) and reporting or commenting on bugs that you find is a massive help. The next level is to contribute and create a [pull request](/pulls).

## What does it look like right now?
