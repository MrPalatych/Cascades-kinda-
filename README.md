# NT Style for Windows
![NT Style banner](/misc/banner.png)

## README NOTICE!!!
NT Style will soon be rebranded as Cascades and will have a massive increase in functionality. Unfortunately, the largest hurdle that I am currently (and have been) fighting is time as well as information. If anyone can study how WindowBlinds manages to unhook UxTheme and provide an implementation, or assist with one, help is greatly appreciated. Until then, the current release of NT Style isn't going to receive much support until Cascades is ready for testing. If you want to see how far I've gotten (not very as of June 24) then you can take a look at the Cascades branch of this repository. Currently planned are styles that resemble Windows 1-3 as well as OS/2 and the recently leaked Chicago Build 22. Once the hook is implemented in Cascades it should take about a week to have a public release ready for testing.

## What is NT Style?
NT Style makes your computer look like it's straight out of 1993! Using window hooks, every control and titlebar is turned into something straight from vintage Windows.

## What does it run on?
Support and compatibility is provided for all versions of Windows NT with kernel version 5.2 and newer. There is currently only support for IA-32 and AMD64 releases.

## Where do I get it?
The [releases page](https://github.com/freedom7341/NTStyle/releases/latest) has the latest stable release of NT Style. Builds for every commit can be found in the artifacts of the GitHub actions run of said commit.

## How can I help?
Submitting [issues](/issues) and reporting or commenting on bugs that you find is a massive help. The next level is to contribute and create a [pull request](/pulls).

## What does it look like right now?
