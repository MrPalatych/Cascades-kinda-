![Cascades theme utility by Vortesys](/misc/cascadesbeta.jpg)

## What is *Cascades*?
*Cascades* is a theme utility designed to make your computer look like classic operating systems such as Windows 3.1 and OS/2. Using the same method that Stardock's *Windowblinds* and Microsoft's *UxTheme* employ, every titlebar and button is skinned with a vintage look.

## What does it run on?
Support and compatibility for *Cascades* is provided for all versions of Windows XP and newer. This program is currently untested and unsupported on any non-x86/AMD64 platforms. This program is not compatible with Windows 2000 and older.

## Where do I get it?
The [releases page](https://github.com/Vortesys/Cascades/releases/latest) has the latest stable release of *Cascades*. Builds for every commit can be found in the GitHub Actions artifacts of each commit. In the future, this program will be bundled with others and form a program suite to bring back the early 90s desktop paradigm.

## How can I help?
Submitting [issues](/issues) and reporting or reproducing bugs is a major help. The next level is to contribute code and create a [pull request](/pulls). All feature requests are welcome but not all of them may be added in. If you're not sure about something, ask!
